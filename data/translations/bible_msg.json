And this is why: so that no one need be destroyed; by believing in him, anyone can have a whole and lasting life. God didn\u2019t go to all the trouble of sending his Son merely to point an accusing finger, telling the world how bad it was. He came to help, to put the world right again. Anyone who trusts in him is acquitted; anyone who refuses to trust him has long since been under the death sentence without knowing it. And why? Because of that person\u2019s failure to believe in the one-of-a-kind Son of God when introduced to him."
